        Evolutionary game theory can also highlight and explain evolutionary 
        changes in behavior, then natural selection can help them mutate genes that get 
        them more rewards at less cost for the strategies they have. Obviously the world 
        is complex and there are many other constraints in real life (e.g. what if food was 
        limited? What if you’re lifepoints/health dropped over time? What if food had a 
        diminishing effect the more full you were?) However, evolutionary game theory 
        gives us a glimpse into understanding how math can be prevalent in life and nature.

        It’s a possibility that changes in behavior and changes 
        in physical expression of genes go hand in hand.
